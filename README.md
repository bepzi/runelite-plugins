# Automatic Low Detail

Automatically turn off ground decorations while inside certain areas (like raids)

Improves floor tile visibility without having to manually toggle the Low Detail plugin each time you enter or leave an area. This is especially useful for intense PvM encounters.

This plugin was originally based on [Low Detail Chambers](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/low-detail-chambers) ([github](https://github.com/JacobLindelof/runelite-plugins/tree/low-detail-chambers)), extended to support the other two raid encounters, etc. as well as being toggleable per-area.

### Supported areas

- Chambers of Xeric
- Theatre of Blood
- Tombs of Amascut
