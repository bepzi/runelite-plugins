# Low Detail Raids

Automatically turn off ground decorations while inside raids

Improves floor tile visibility during intense PvM encounters without having to manually toggle the Low Detail plugin each time you enter or leave a raid.

This plugin was originally based on [Low Detail Chambers](https://runelite.net/plugin-hub/show/low-detail-chambers) ([github](https://github.com/JacobLindelof/runelite-plugins/tree/low-detail-chambers)), extended to support the other two raid encounters as well as being toggleable per-raid type.
